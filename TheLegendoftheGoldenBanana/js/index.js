var q1="You wake up. Your head is pounding, your thoughts blurred and messy.  You look at your arms, and see that it is covered with brown hair. Beside you is a map and a note. The note says that you have turned into a monkey, and that you need to find a Golden Banana to return to your original human form. You inspect the map, and see a big red X on a point, saying Golden Banana There are two routes to the banana. Do you take the cliffside route or the beach route?"
var q2="You decide to take the cliffside route, a very rocky path. You walk a few kilometres alone, until you meet another monkey on the path. She introduces herself as Johanna, another monkey-human looking for the Golden Banana. Should you befriend her, not, or get rid of her as she may be competition on who eats the banana?"
var q3="You decide to befriend her as she could become useful in the future. You move forward with her for a few days, collecting food and water together. As you near the Golden Banana, there appears a high ledge. The only way to get up is to help each other up. Johanna offers to help you up, so you use her as a stool and climb onto the ledge. Now you need to help Johanna up. Do you help her, or not?"
var q4="You decide not to befriend her, but leave her be. You walk slightly ahead of her, and in your hurry to reach the Golden Banana, you trip and fall down the cliff. However, Johanna catches you by the ankle just in time, and pulls you up. You say a quick thanks, and race ahead. Sooner or later, you reach the Golden Banana. Just when you are about to eat it, Johanna arrives. You remember that she saved your life, so you feel guilty about eating the banana. Only one monkey can eat the banana, do you let her eat it, or will you?"
var q5="You decide to go for the beach route. You walk for a few kilometres alone, until you come across a group of monkeys heading for the Golden Banana together. They look determined to reach the Golden Banana, and the tensions seem high. Will you show yourself to the group, or will you stay quiet?"
var q6="You hide in the shadows, dilligently tailing the group until darkness covers the sky and night falls. The group stops and sets up a miniature camp. They eat a frugal dinner, and fall asleep soon after. While they are slumbering, should you steal some food, or not?"
var q7="You decide to steal food from the group camping. You make sure that they are all fast asleep, and sneak into their camp. You silently take some food from their bags, and sneak back out. The next morning, the group falls into disarray, due to arguments over who ate too much food. The night comes yet again. Do you wish to steal some more food and supplies?" 
var q8="You decide to reveal yourself to the group. You step out from behind a rock, and call out for the group. They stop and look back. Wary, they come to you, and ask who you are. You say that you are another monkey-human looking for the Golden Banana. You ask if you can join the group, and they mumble that you can. You happily join them. After a few days, you reach the Golden Banana with the rest of the group. You and the leader of the group did the most work for the group. Should you eat it or should the leader?"

var s1="You give her an apologetic smile, and race forward for the golden banana... except there is no 'Golden Banana'. Just a normal banana. There is a note by the banana, so you read it. It says: To the monkey reading this-there is no golden banana. You are a genetically modified monkey implanted with human memories and thinking skills. To get to this banana, you must have betrayed anyone you met, or used your thinking to solve some problems. The fact that you are reading this is proof that my experiments have succeeded. - Dr. Kwok Tsang. With nothing left to live for after knowing the truth, you sit down and eat the banana, taking in the silence. END"
var s2="Because you are a kind soul, you reach down to help up Johanna. She gratefully takes your hand, and you hoist her up. However, as soon as she is up, she pushes you down. She grins at you, and races off into the distance. You are now stuck, so you give up. END"
var s3="Being the nice person you are, you give Johanna the Golden Banana. She smiles wryly, and eats the Golden Banana. Before your eyes, Johanna grows, and twists, and convulses, until she finally turns into a human woman. She looks at you and spits at you, and says that you are naive. She leaves, and you are now forever condemned to be a monkey because of your naivety. END"
var s4="No matter how guilty, you come before others. You eat the banana, and after seconds of excruciating pain, you turn into a human. Johanna, still a monkey, stares at you. You feel a pang of regret in your chest. You pick up Johanna and take her back as a pet. END"
var s5="You sense that she would become a nuisance in the future, as only one monkey can eat the Golden Banana. When her back is turned to you, you throw a rock at her head. It hits viciously, and she falls. You, happy that you got rid of an obstacle quickly, run forwards. Johanna, however, will not go down so soon. She stands up, and throws an even bigger rock at you. Not expected that, you succumb to the attack, and fall. END"
var s6="Without bothering to stop and try to steal some measly food, you instead race far ahead. You run, and run, and run, until you reach the cave with the Golden Banana. You stop, catch your breath, and with a broad smile, eat the banana. With triumph in your heart, you turn into a human! END"
var s7="Choosing not to steal anything else, you go straight for your goal-the Golden Banana. You traverse lands far and wide, until you finally arrive at the much sought-after cave which holds the Golden Banana. You carefully go inside, but find nothing. The Golden Banana is gone, you realise, as you had wasted too much time. You sit down, with nothing more to do. END"
var s8="You think why not, so you once more wait until the night. Once more you see the group, and go to steal some more food and supplies. You tiptoe into the camp, and quietly take some more supplies from the bags. However, as soon as you put your hand in the bad, the camp members jump out of their tents and grab you. They smirk, ridiculing you for your terrible efforts. They tie you up and put you in a cave, condemning you to a dark life."
var s9="You don't care about what the leader did. You know for a fact that it was you who did the most work, so you go to the front and eat the banana without consulting anyone else. You turn into a human, but as you turn to leave, the monkeys furiously attack you, and you are hurt viciously. They capture you, and now you cannot escape. END"
var s10="You respect the efforts of the leader, so you give the banana to the leader, and he gratefully eats it. Before your very eyes he turns into a human, and he takes in you and all the rest to return to the human world. END"
